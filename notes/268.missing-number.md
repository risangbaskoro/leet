Notes:

Looking at the constraints, one of which is stated that
"All the numbers of nums are *unique*",

So we can conclude that the missing number must be equal
to the sum of nums minus the sum of the range of the length num.

Note that we add `1` to the `len(nums)` because the end param of the
range function is inclusive.


Example:
  - nums = [3,0,1]
      - n = 3
      - sum of nums = 3 + 0 + 1 = 4
      - sum of the range of nums = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
      - answer = 6 - 4 = 2

  - nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
      - n = 9
      - sum of nums = 9 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 0 + 1 = 37
      - sum of the range of nums = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45
      - answer = 45 - 37 = 8
