## Set approach

Of course we can use list comprehension to return the missing numbers.

But there's a catch:

In the first example of the problem, it was given that the `nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]`,
which has some repeating numbers. Imagine if `nums` is a really large list!

To accomodate that, we can first have a `set_nums` variable, which assigned to the unique
elements in `nums`. That we can accomplish using the `set()` function.

```python
set_nums = set(nums)
```

And then, we can return the list as we build it!

```python
return [i for i in range(1, len(nums) + 1) if i in set_nums]
```

- Remember that the range is `[1, n]`.
- Also remember that the `end` param in `range` function is inclusive, so we add `1`.


## Preserving Space

One way to preserve space is to avoid having the `set_nums` like the above.

That is because, imagine we have an input where `len(nums)` is `3000` with only `2` missing numbers.
We then created `set_nums` with `len(set_nums)` is `2998`. That is a huge list.

To accomodate this, we could modify nums first that will beneficial in our returned value creation.
Since the constraints are:
- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- 1 <= nums[i] <= n

We can modify each element in `nums` so that existing element is negative. We can multiply it with `-1`.

```python
for i in range(len(nums)):
    temp = abs(nums[i]) - 1
    if nums[temp] > 0:
        nums[temp] *= -1
```

Then, when returning, using list comprehension again, we can check if the element is positive.
If `n > 0`, add that `i`.

```python
return [i + 1 for i, n in enumerate(nums) if n > 0]
```

Do not forget that the range is `[1, n]`, so when we enumerating, we add 1 to the index enumeration.
